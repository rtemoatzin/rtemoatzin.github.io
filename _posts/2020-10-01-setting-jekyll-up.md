Setting this blog up!

I decided to write a blog the things I learn about development, and since I learned a couple things I want to write down about Machine learning, I started this website.  
But I have to say, it wasn't that easy.

I first started using [this Jekyll tutorial](https://onextrapixel.com/start-jekyll-blog-github-pages-free/) to get started, I installed ruby, jekyll and everything needed to make it work, but as soon I had the basic blog, I couldn't change the style or view my new posts.  
I almost give up trying after an hour. Then I looked for Jekyll templates to see what I could do.

After looking a few themes and templates, I read the documentation [in this repo](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll#readme) and followed the _easy instructions_ that provided. It worked like a charm!  
I made some initial configurations, just to set things up, many of the colors are still placeholders, but what I wanted to get ready was this post functionality so I can share my python and data science progress.

I'll see you soon!
