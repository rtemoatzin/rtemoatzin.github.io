So hello!  
Following the advice given by Giles McMullen-Klein from [Youtube Channel Python Programmer](https://www.youtube.com/c/FlickThrough/), I decided to open a blog and write down everything I learn about python, web development and data science, in order to keep track about my progress and as a way to reenforce my knowledge.

I use this blog as a personal journal, and maybe to share with my friends about everything I learn, but I maybe could include it in my resume, CV or linkedin profile. Time will tell, but first I need to expand my portfolio.

That's all for my first entry! I'll see you later.
