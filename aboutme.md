My name is Francisco Temoatzin Rivero Chavarria. I studied at Chapingo Autonomous University and graduated in Agricultural Mechanical Engineering.  
I studied a bit about programming back in school, I learned the basics about C, Matlab and Python. After I graduated I decided to dive in a bit more and now I'm self learning via internet about python, C#, javascript, and data science.

I'll try to pursue a career in data science and I'll try to write down my progress in here.

I hope you enjoy, thanks for reading!
